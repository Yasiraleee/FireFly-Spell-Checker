# FireFly - Spell Check and Word Analysis Website

FireFly is a spell checking website that provides a range of language-related features, including synonym and antonym finding, spelling checking, auto-correction, word resemblance checking, and part-of-speech identification. The backend of the website is built using Python, while the frontend is developed using HTML and CSS. This project was completed within a remarkable timeframe of just 24 days by Yasir.

## Features

1. **Spell Checker**: FireFly enables users to check the spelling of words. It highlights misspelled words and offers suggestions for potential corrections.

2. **Auto Corrector**: The website incorporates an auto-correct feature that automatically rectifies misspelled words, providing users with the correct spellings.

3. **Synonym and Antonym Finder**: Users can search for synonyms and antonyms of specific words. This functionality assists in broadening vocabulary and finding suitable words for diverse contexts.

4. **Word Resemblance Checker**: FireFly includes a word resemblance checker that allows users to assess the similarity between two words. It provides a measure of how closely related the two words are.

5. **Part-of-Speech Finder**: This feature aids in identifying the part of speech (e.g., noun, verb, adjective) for a given word. It facilitates users in understanding the grammatical role of a word within a sentence.
